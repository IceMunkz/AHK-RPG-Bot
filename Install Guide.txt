FAQ
AHK script is included for troubleshooting "ImageSearchTestWorking Bot version with GUI"
ESC to pause


--- How to run ---

#1 Paste "GN" Folder in Root of C (C:\GN\)

#2 Open GN in Chrome

#3 Set your GN chrome window to 100%

4# Run GNBotv1

Watch the status box and anything it seems to skip you need to reaquire images for, sometimes the website will update, move or change the brightness of an image and this can make the bot fail.

It shouldn't be a major issue now that the bot can find images similar but its still a factor on anything that uses FindClick for coords.


--- How to refresh your images ---
The game has a basic anticheat that moves and modifies the page over time, it also lowers opacity, brightness and changes colours very slightly.

Because of this you might need to refresh certain images, the GUI for that is currently broken so

In the GN folder their is a series of images, named due to what they do

You need to take screenshots similar or of the same link as the images listed here and save them as PNGs under the same name in the folder
